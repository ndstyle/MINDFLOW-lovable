ISSUE: Mind map generation appears to be stuck on "Generating Mind Map..." without completing or showing errors.

REQUIRED INVESTIGATION & FIXES:

1. BACKEND API DEBUGGING:

Check if /api/generate-mindmap endpoint is actually receiving requests
Add comprehensive logging to track request flow in server/routes.ts
Verify OpenAI API key is properly configured and working
Test OpenAI API response parsing and error handling
Ensure database saves are working correctly
Add timeout handling for OpenAI requests
2. FRONTEND REQUEST DEBUGGING:

Add detailed console logging to track the entire request flow in Create.tsx
Verify authentication headers are being sent correctly
Add proper error boundaries and timeout handling
Check if the request is actually being sent to the backend
3. AUTHENTICATION FLOW VERIFICATION:

Verify Supabase session is valid before making API calls
Check if auth tokens are being passed correctly in headers
Ensure user profile exists and is accessible
4. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

AGENT MUST TEST ALL OF THESE SCENARIOS:

a) Happy Path Testing:

Enter text → Click Generate → Verify request is sent → Verify backend receives request → Verify OpenAI responds → Verify database save → Verify navigation to mindmap view
b) Error Scenario Testing:

Test with invalid/missing OpenAI API key
Test with network connectivity issues
Test with malformed text input
Test with authentication failures
Test database connection failures
c) User Experience Testing:

Verify loading states work correctly
Verify error messages are shown to user
Verify success navigation works
Test button states (disabled during loading)
5. DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTATION:

Add these debugging logs throughout the flow:

Frontend: Request start, request payload, response received, error caught
Backend: Request received, auth verified, OpenAI call start, OpenAI response, database save, final response
Include timestamps and request IDs for tracing
6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION:

Once issues are identified:

Fix any broken API endpoints
Add proper error handling and user feedback
Implement request timeouts (30 seconds max)
Add retry logic for transient failures
Ensure proper state management in frontend
7. VALIDATION TESTING CHECKLIST:

AGENT MUST VERIFY ALL OF THESE WORK:
✓ Text input → Generate button → Loading state → Success navigation
✓ Network error → Proper error message shown to user
✓ Invalid input → Validation error shown
✓ Authentication failure → Redirect to auth page
✓ Database error → Error message with retry option
✓ OpenAI API failure → Fallback or error handling
✓ Timeout scenarios → Proper timeout handling
✓ Mind map loads correctly after generation
✓ User can navigate back to dashboard
✓ Generated mindmap appears in dashboard list

CRITICAL: Agent must actually test each scenario by:

Making real requests with real data
Checking network tab for request/response details
Verifying database records are created
Testing error scenarios by simulating failures
Confirming user experience from start to finish
DO NOT CONSIDER TASK COMPLETE UNTIL:

All debugging logs are implemented
Root cause is identified and fixed
All test scenarios pass with real data
User experience flows smoothly end-to-end
Proper error handling exists for all failure modes
