Building on the completed Supabase cloud integration, implement a comprehensive learning suite centered on a **powerful quiz system inspired by Knowt and Quizlet**, along with flashcards, advanced mindmap features, AI chatbot improvements, collaboration, and gamification enhancements, fully integrated and tested end-to-end:

**Quiz System (Knowt/Quizlet style):**  
- AI-generated quizzes analyzing mindmap content with diverse question types: multiple-choice (single and multi-select), true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and matching pairs.  
- Questions cover key concepts, definitions, and relationships, with difficulty levels inferred from node importance and user history.  
- Intuitive, clean frontend UI featuring:  
  - Clear question presentation with appropriate input controls (radio buttons, checkboxes, drag-and-drop).  
  - Immediate feedback after each question highlighting correct answers and explanations.  
  - Navigation to skip, review, or revisit questions before final submission.  
  - Optional timers for quizzes or individual questions.  
- Progress tracking with XP awarding based on accuracy, speed, and streaks; dynamic display of progress bars, scores, and achievement badges.  
- Study mode with hints and explanations, and test mode simulating exam conditions with no immediate feedback.  
- Fully accessible and mobile-responsive quiz interface.  
- Backend stores quizzes and user responses in Supabase with rich schema supporting all question types, options, answers, explanations, and attempt history; strict RLS enforcement ensures user data privacy.  
- API endpoints for quiz creation, retrieval, submission, grading, and exporting quizzes as PDFs.  
- Shareable quiz links with controlled access.

**Flashcards:**  
- AI-generated flashcards from mindmaps with Q/A pairs.  
- Interactive frontend with flip animations, known/unknown tracking, and XP rewards.  
- Backend storage and APIs fully integrated with Supabase and RLS.

**Enhanced Mindmap Visualization:**  
- Drag-and-drop node repositioning with snap-to-grid and smooth animations.  
- Animated edges with highlight effects on hover.  
- Distinct icons/colors per node type and detailed tooltips.  
- Zoom-to-node search functionality.

**AI Chatbot Enhancements:**  
- Context-aware commands enabling add/remove nodes, selective quiz/flashcard generation, and node styling (colors/icons).  
- Real-time syncing of edits to Supabase backend.

**Collaboration:**  
- Backend collaboration sessions with shareable tokens supporting read/write permissions.  
- Frontend UI for generating share links, joining sessions, and real-time updates between collaborators.

**Gamification Expansion:**  
- Achievement system tracking streaks, quiz mastery, and flashcard progress.  
- Unlockable themes and features that modify mindmap appearance and app UI.

**Innovative Features:**  
- Smart AI-generated summaries of mindmaps or branches.  
- Adaptive learning paths personalized by quiz and flashcard performance.  
- Version history with undo/redo capabilities for mindmaps.  
- Offline mode with local caching and sync on reconnect.  
- Multimedia node support (images, videos, audio).  
- Mindmap templates for common use cases.  
- Custom node styling saved per user.  
- Notifications and reminders for practice and updates.  
- Multi-format exports: PDF, Markdown, OPML, interactive HTML.  
- AI-powered natural language search across mindmaps.  
- Integration with calendar and task managers.  
- Collaborative annotations with comments, highlights, and voice notes.  
- Accessibility improvements including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  
- Public API exposing core functionality for third-party integrations.

**Technical Requirements:**  
- All backend database and auth operations use Supabase JS client with strict enforcement of RLS policies.  
- Authentication via Supabase email/password and JWT validation on backend.  
- Frontend consumes updated API endpoints with graceful error handling and loading states.  
- Modular implementation with clear separation of concerns, enabling phased development and testing.  
- Preserve all existing working features; extend and integrate cleanly.  
- Prioritize performance, security, and a polished, engaging user experience.

Deliver a visually appealing, highly interactive, and user-centric learning platform combining AI-powered content generation, deep customization, and collaborative learning, fully hosted and running seamlessly on Replit with Supabase backend.
