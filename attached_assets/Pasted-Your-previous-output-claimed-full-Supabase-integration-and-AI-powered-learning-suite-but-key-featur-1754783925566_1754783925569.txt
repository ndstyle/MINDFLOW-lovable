Your previous output claimed full Supabase integration and AI-powered learning suite, but key features are missing or incomplete: quizzes, flashcards, advanced interactive mindmaps, AI chat editing, collaboration, and gamification.

NOW, you must:

1. Fully build the **quiz system** like Quizlet/Knowt with:  
   - AI-generated questions (MCQ, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, matching) from mindmap content  
   - Interactive frontend UI with instant feedback, navigation controls, timers  
   - XP awarding based on performance, progress tracking, achievement badges  
   - Backend Supabase schema and APIs supporting quiz storage, grading, user attempts with RLS  

2. Fully build the **flashcard system** with:  
   - AI-generated flashcards linked to mindmaps  
   - Flip animation, known/unknown tracking, XP rewards  
   - Backend APIs and Supabase integration with strict access controls  

3. Enhance **mindmap visualization** to be:  
   - Visually appealing with drag-and-drop node repositioning and snap-to-grid  
   - Animated edges and node hover highlights  
   - Multiple node types with distinct colors and icons  
   - Zoom and search to focus on nodes  

4. Improve **AI chatbot** so it can:  
   - Add/remove nodes via chat commands  
   - Generate quizzes and flashcards for selected mindmap areas  
   - Style nodes dynamically and sync changes to Supabase  

5. Implement **collaboration features**:  
   - Shareable session tokens with read/write permissions  
   - Real-time updates syncing changes among collaborators  
   - Frontend UI for sharing and joining sessions  

6. Expand **gamification**:  
   - Track achievements, streaks, quiz mastery  
   - Unlock themes and features impacting UI and mindmap styles  

7. Deliver all features with:  
   - Complete frontend-backend integration using Supabase JS client and Express APIs  
   - Strict RLS enforcement ensuring data privacy and security  
   - Responsive, accessible UI with polished styling  
   - Thorough testing with demo data, showing working quizzes, flashcards, and mindmaps  

DO NOT produce placeholder UI or partial functionality. This must be a fully functional, user-ready learning platform matching the original specifications and feature requests.

After implementation, generate a demo quiz and flashcard from a sample mindmap (e.g. “AP World”) and demonstrate interactive mindmap editing via chatbot commands.

Proceed incrementally with clear commits, prioritizing user experience and integration correctness.
