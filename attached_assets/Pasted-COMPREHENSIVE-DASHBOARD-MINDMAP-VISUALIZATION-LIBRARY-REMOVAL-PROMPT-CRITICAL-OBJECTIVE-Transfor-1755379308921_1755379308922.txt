COMPREHENSIVE DASHBOARD MINDMAP VISUALIZATION & LIBRARY REMOVAL PROMPT

CRITICAL OBJECTIVE: Transform Dashboard into the central hub for ALL mindmap management, remove redundant Library and Upload pages, and ensure proper mindmap navigation flow.

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. Dashboard Mind Map Visualization Fix (client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx):

Make ALL mind map cards clickable to navigate to /mindmap/{id} route
Add proper onClick handlers: onClick={() => setLocation(/mindmap/${mindmap.id})}
Add visual hover effects (cursor-pointer, hover:shadow-lg) to indicate clickability
Keep existing delete functionality working
Remove the "your library" card completely from the dashboard grid
Remove the "upload document" card completely from the dashboard grid
Update the grid layout to accommodate removed cards (adjust grid-cols)
2. Complete Library Page Removal:

Delete client/src/pages/Library.tsx file entirely
Remove /library route from client/src/App.tsx router configuration
Remove Library import from App.tsx
Delete any remaining references to Library component
3. Complete Upload Page/Feature Removal:

Delete client/src/pages/Upload.tsx file entirely
Remove /upload route from client/src/App.tsx router configuration
Remove Upload import from App.tsx
Delete any remaining references to Upload component
4. Header Navigation Updates (client/src/components/Header.tsx):

Remove ALL references to /library links
Remove ALL references to /upload links and "Upload Document" buttons
Remove "upload document" navigation item
Keep only: home, create mind map navigation items for authenticated users
Update navigation structure to reflect removed features
5. Mind Map View Navigation (client/src/pages/MindMapView.tsx):

Change ALL "Back to Library" references to "Back to Dashboard"
Update navigation to route to /dashboard instead of /library
Ensure proper back navigation: onClick={() => setLocation('/dashboard')}
6. Remove Upload References Throughout Codebase:

Remove upload-related components and imports
Remove document upload functionality references
Clean up any upload-related routes or navigation
SUCCESS CRITERIA - AGENT MUST TEST ALL OF THESE:

Dashboard displays mind map cards correctly ✓
Mind map cards are clickable and navigate to /mindmap/{id} ✓
Navigation flow works: Dashboard → Click mindmap → View mindmap → Back to Dashboard ✓
No broken links or references to /library or /upload exist ✓
Delete functionality works from Dashboard ✓
No 404 errors when accessing removed routes ✓
Header navigation is clean and functional ✓
Router configuration has no dead routes ✓
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Use setLocation(/mindmap/${mindmap.id}) for navigation
Add proper CSS classes: cursor-pointer hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow to cards
Ensure onClick doesn't interfere with delete button clicks
Update router in App.tsx to remove /library and /upload routes
Remove all import statements for deleted components
Test navigation flow thoroughly after implementation
CRITICAL TESTING CHECKLIST - AGENT MUST VERIFY:

Create a mindmap → appears on dashboard → click card → opens mindmap → back to dashboard works
No console errors about missing routes or components
Dashboard layout looks proper without library/upload cards
All navigation links work correctly
Delete functionality still works
No references to removed features remain anywhere
DO NOT:

Change mindmap data structure or API endpoints
Modify authentication flow
Alter mindmap generation or visualization logic
Change database schema or API routes
Touch working Create page functionality
DEPLOYMENT NOTE: After implementation, agent must thoroughly test the entire navigation flow and verify no broken links exist before considering the task complete.
