PHASE 2: COMPLETE MIND MAP GENERATION & VISUALIZATION IMPLEMENTATION

Objective: Implement the full flow from text input → AI mind map generation → visual display that EXACTLY matches the provided reference design.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Mind Map Structure (Must Match Reference)

ONLY Topic and Concept nodes (no leaf/atomic nodes)
Structure stops at exactly 2-3 levels as shown in screenshot
1 root topic → 3-5 main concepts → 2-3 sub-concepts per main concept
No deeper nesting beyond level 2-3
Visual Layout (Copy Reference Design Exactly)

Left-to-right radial layout with root node positioned on the left
Main branches expand horizontally to the right
Each branch uses distinct colors (no 3D effects, shadows, or gradients)
Smooth curved connection lines (never blocky or jagged)
Rounded rectangles for all node labels
Proper text wrapping within nodes
Auto-scale to fit all content clearly in view
Export Functionality

"Generate Image" button floating near root node
Export as PNG functionality
FILES TO MODIFY:

A. Server-side Generation (server/services/mindmap-generator.ts)

Update OpenAI prompt to generate ONLY 2-3 level hierarchical structure
Ensure output format matches visualization component requirements
Generate proper positioning data for left-to-right layout
Assign distinct colors to different branch families
B. Visualization Component (client/src/components/MindMapVisualization.tsx)

Complete rewrite to match reference design exactly
Implement left-to-right radial layout algorithm
Create smooth curved SVG paths for connections
Add proper node styling with rounded rectangles
Implement text wrapping and auto-sizing
Add zoom/pan controls if needed
C. Styling (client/src/components/mindmap-styles.css)

New CSS file with styles matching reference design
Define color palette for different branches
Responsive design for different screen sizes
D. Integration (client/src/pages/Create.tsx and client/src/pages/View.tsx)

Ensure seamless flow from generation to visualization
Handle loading states during generation
Display visualization component with generated data
Add export functionality integration
IMPLEMENTATION FLOW:

User inputs text →
Server generates structured mind map data →
Client receives data and renders visualization →
User can export as image
SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Visual output matches reference screenshot exactly
Generation creates proper 2-3 level hierarchy
All nodes are clearly readable with proper spacing
Export functionality works correctly
Responsive design works on different screen sizes
